# pyResolutionChanger

A simple python tray app to quick switch between display resolutions.

Some games do not support ultra-wide monitors and need the display resolution set to 1920x1080 to function properly.
This app saves me a bunch of clicks each time I need to change resolution.

## How it Works

Right click to open the menu and select the desired resolution.

You can click the tray icon to switch between the current and previously selected resolution.
